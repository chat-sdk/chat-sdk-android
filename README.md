## Performance and Scalability

These are the average Firebase hosting costs calculated using the Firebase Database Profiling tool. Firebase charge 1 USD per GB of data downloaded (excluding images or files). We've tabulated a few common operations and how many of them can be performed per 1 USD of monthly hosting cost:

- Messages Received (1kb) = 1,000,000
- Logins (10kb) = 100,000
- Profile Update (0.2kb) = 5,000,000
- User search (2kb) = 500,000 

What's possible on the Firebase free plan (10GB / month):

**500k logins, 5 million messages.** 

What's possible on the Flame plan (20GB / month / 20 USD):

**1 million logins, 10 million messages.**

The real-time database will support up to **100k concurrent users**. From our experience, 1 concurrent connection is enough to support 10 users per minute. That means that at peak capacity, the Chat SDK could support **1 million users per minute** and well over **20 million monthly users**.

	- User availability
	- Country
- Update to message view
	- Efficiency improvements
- Screens updated to use Material Design

There are also a range of bug fixes and overall improvments. If we aren't able to document all the changes but if you have any issues updating your project, you can post on this [issue](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-android/issues/533) and we will answer your questions. 

The [security rules](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-firebase) have also been updated so make sure to bring your project up to date. 		

Several schema have also been deprecated and will be removed at some point in the future. These include:

- `message/to` field added
- `message/meta` will replace `json_v2`
- `message/from` will replace `user-firebase-id`
- `thread/meta` will replace `details`
- `thread/meta/creator` will replace `creator-entity-id`
- `thread/meta/type` will replace `type_v4`

At the moment these fields are not being used and are only included for future compatibility. However, in a future version of the client, the old fields will be removed and any old versions of the client will stop working.

## Running the demo project

This repository contains a fully functional version of the Chat SDK which is configured using our Firebase account and social media logins. This is great way to test the features of the Chat SDK before you start integrating it with your app. 

> **Note:**
>You should make sure that the correct SDK versions and build tools are installed in Android Studio. To do this open the Preferences panel and navigate to **Appearance & Behavour** -> **System Settings** -> **Android SDK** or click on the **SDK Manager** icon in the tool bar. Android SDK versions 8.1 and onwards should be installed. **Android SDK Build-Tools** version that is defined in the [`gradle.properties`](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-android/blob/master/gradle.properties) file under the `ANDROID_BUILD_TOOLS_VERSION` property. 

The next step is to setup the Chat SDK using your Firebase and Social Accounts. To do that continue [here](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-android#firebase-setup).

### Setup Service

We provide extensive documentation on Github but if you’re a non-technical user or want to save yourself some work you can take advantage of our [setup and integration service](http://chatsdk.co/downloads/chat-sdk-setup-service/).

## Adding the Chat SDK to your project
###### Quick start guide - it takes about 10 minutes!

Integration with an existing project is simple. You can add the core libraries using Gradle. 

### Gradle

Until the project is published in jCenter, you will need to include the repository manually:

```
repositories {
    maven { url "http://dl.bintray.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-android" }
    maven { url "https://maven.google.com" }
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
```

Then add this to your `dependencies` area:

```
compile 'co.chatsdk.chatsdk:chat-sdk-core:4.8.9'
compile 'co.chatsdk.chatsdk:chat-sdk-ui:4.8.9'
compile 'co.chatsdk.chatsdk:chat-sdk-firebase-adapter:4.8.9'
compile 'co.chatsdk.chatsdk:chat-sdk-firebase-file-storage:4.8.9'
```

You may also need to enable Java 8:

```
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
}
```

You can also add the [modules manually](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-android#adding-modules-manually) by downloading source code and importing the modules to Android Studio. 

Firebase depends on Google Services so we need to apply the google services plugin. This will read the **Google Services** file that we will add during Firebase setup. Add this to your top level `build.gradle` file.

```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.0.1'
    }
}
```

Add this to the end of your app level `build.gradle` file:

```
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

#### Android X

Make sure you've added the following to your `gradle.properties` file:

```
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true
```

### Initializing the Chat SDK

Now open your applications's main class and find the `onCreate` method. Add the following to setup the Chat SDK:

```
Context context = getApplicationContext();

try {
    // Create a new configuration
    Configuration.Builder builder = new Configuration.Builder();

    // Perform any other configuration steps (optional)
    builder.firebaseRootPath("prod");

    // Initialize the Chat SDK
    ChatSDK.initialize(context, builder.build(), FirebaseNetworkAdapter.class, BaseInterfaceAdapter.class);
    
    // File storage is needed for profile image upload and image messages
    FirebaseFileStorageModule.activate();

    // Push notification module
    FirebasePushModule.activate();

    // Activate any other modules you need.
    // ...
    
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle any exceptions
    e.printStackTrace();
}

``` 

Activate the core Chat SDK modules and any other modules you need. See the module setup guide for more information. 

Launch the Chat SDK login activity by adding this to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```
<activity android:name="co.chatsdk.ui.login.SplashScreenActivity">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

Or if you want to launch the activity manually, you can do it using:

```
ChatSDK.ui().startSplashScreenActivity(context);
``` 

## Firebase Setup

1. Go to the [Firebase](http://firebase.com/) website and sign up or log in
2. Go to the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and make a new project
3. Click **Add project**
4. Choose a name and a location
5. Click **Settings** (the gear icon). On the General tab, click **Add App -> Add Firebase to your Android app**
6. Enter your package name - found in your app's `build.gradle` file, app name and SHA-1 key (optional)
7. Download the **google-services.json** file and add it to your app project. It should be added inside the `app` folder.
8. Set a custom root path. The chat SDK allows you to run multiple chat instances on one Firebase database. This could be useful if you want *test* and *production* environments for example. To do this set `builder.firebaseRootPath("prod")` in the configuration builder.  
9. In the Firebase dashboard click **Authentication -> Sign-in method** and enable all the appropriate methods 

### Security Rules

Firebase secures your data by allowing you to write rules to govern who can access the database and what can be written. The rules are also needed to enable user search. To enable the rules see the guide [Enabling Security Rules](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-firebase).

### Push Notifications

Follow the instructions on our [Chat SDK Firebase repository](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-firebase)

Then add the following to your `build.gradle`

##### Add the library

*Gradle*

```
compile 'co.chatsdk.chatsdk:chat-sdk-firebase-push:4.8.9.3'
```

[*Manual Import*](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-android#adding-modules-manually)

```
compile project(path: ':chat-sdk-firebase-push')
```

##### Enable the module

In your main class `onCreate` method add:

```
FirebasePushModule.activate();
```

### Enabling location messages

The Chat SDK needs two google services to support location messages. The [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/) to select the location and the [Google Static Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/static-maps/) to display the location.

Add the following during the configuration stage:

```
builder.googleMaps("YOUR GOOGLE MAPS STATIC API KEY");
```

You will also need to add your Google Places API key to the app manifest:

```
<meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY" android:value="YOUR GOOGLE PLACES API KEY"/>
```
>**Note:**
> You need to enable billing in your google cloud console or else you will not be able to view map images in your messages, For more information visit the [Google usage and billing support page](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/usage-and-billing#important-enable-billing)

You can disable location messages using the `builder.locationMessagesEnabled(false)` option. 

### Conclusion

Congratulations! 🎉🎉 You've just turned your app into a fully featured instant messenger! Keep reading below to learn how to further customize the Chat SDK.

# Next Steps

## Check out the Development Guide

We've written a [comprehensive Development Guide](https://github.com/chat-sdk/docs) which is available in the docs repository. 

If you thing that something is missing, you can post a new issue and we will update the guide. 

We have a number of additional guides available on our [Wiki](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-android/wiki).

Also checkout the other guides:

1. [Build a custom push notification handler](https://github.com/chat-sdk/docs/blob/master/Custom%20Push%20Handler.md)


## UI Customization

The Chat SDK is designed to be easily customizable. If you want to customize any of the activities you can do it using the `ui` api. 

```
// You could define a custom LoginActivity subclass here
ChatSDK.ui().setLoginActivity(YourLoginActivity.class);
        
// Or customise the profile fragment
ChatSDK.ui().setProfileFragmentProvider(user -> YourProfileFragment.newInstance(user));
```

Every activity and fragment can be customized this way. 

## Configuration

The Chat SDK can be customized during setup using the configuration builder object. For a full list of options, take a look at [here](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-android/blob/master/chat-sdk-core/src/main/java/co/chatsdk/core/session/Configuration.java). 

#### Configuration using the Configuration Builder

In your main `onCreate` method you create a new instance of the `Configuration.Builder` and pass it to the `ChatSDK` singleton on initialization.

Here you have the option to set far more properties. For example:

##### Disable Facebook and Twitter login

```
builder.facebookLoginEnabled(false);
builder.twitterLoginEnabled(false);
```

##### Set a custom user name and avatar

```
builder.defaultUserName("TestUser");
builder.defaultUserAvatarUrl("http://your-site/image.png");
```

Remember that in the instructions we will advise you to configure using the Android Manifest but you are always free to use the direct configuration method instead.

## Module Setup

There are a number of free and premium extensions that can be added to the Chat SDK.

  Add the following to your `chat_sdk_firebase.xml` file:
  
  ```
  <string name="facebook_app_identifier">[FACEBOOK APP KEY]</string>
  ```
  
6. Go back to the Facebook site and click "Add Platform". Choose Android and enter your **Bundle ID**. Then you will need to enter add the **Key Hashes** property. To do this first generate a [key store](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html) for your app. Then generate the hash by running the following on MacOS:

  ```
  keytool -exportcert -alias <RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS> -keystore <RELEASE_KEY_PATH> | openssl sha1 -  binary | openssl base64
  ```

  On Windows, use:

  ```

5. Add the following to the configuration where you initialize the Chat SDK:

  ```
  config.twitterLogin("consumer key", "consumer secret");
  ```

#### Google
  
1. If you haven't yet specified your app's SHA-1 fingerprint, do so from the [Settings page](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/general/) of the Firebase console. See [Authenticating Your Client](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth) for details on how to get your app's SHA-1 fingerprint.

  ```
  keytool -exportcert -alias [KEY ALIAS] -keystore [PATH/TO/KEYSTORE] -list -v  
  ```
  
 >**Note:**
 >You may need to add multiple keys for debug and release

2. In the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), open the **Auth** section.
3. On the **Sign in method** tab, enable the **Google** sign-in method and click **Save**.

This will prompt the modules to use local versions of the core Chat SDK modules rather than the versions hosted on Gradle. 

#### Configuring the project

Now that the modules have been added, we need to configure the project. 

**SDK Version**

Now you will see that gradle cannot be sync because it missing some parameters. Open to **gradle.properties** file in the root of the project and make sure the following lines are set to the [latest values](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-android/blob/master/gradle.properties).

```
MIN_SDK = 16
ANDROID_BUILD_TARGET_SDK_VERSION = 25
ANDROID_COMPILE_SDK_VERSION = 28
ANDROID_SUPPORT_VERSION = 28.0.0
```

> **Note:**
>You should make sure that the correct SDK versions and build tools are installed in Android Studio. To do this open the Preferences panel and navigate to **Appearance & Behavior** -> **System Settings** -> **Android SDK** or click on the **SDK Manager** icon in the tool bar. Android SDK versions 4.4 and onwards should be installed. **Android SDK Build-Tools** version 21.1.0 should be installed. 

Add any other modules that you need. Then sync the project with gradle. 

## Backend agnostic architecture

The user interface for the Chat SDK is completely decoupled from the backend. This means that the Chat SDK can be adapted to connect to any type of messaging server by creating a custom network adapter. Currently we have written two network adapters, one for Firebase and another for XMPP. This has a number of benefits:

1. You can connect the Chat SDK user interface to your messaging server by writing a custom network adapter. This saves you the complex job of building a full user interface. 

2. You can switch the backend your app uses. Imagine that you decide to start off with the Firebase version of the Chat SDK but at some point you decide that you want to switch to using an XMPP server. Usually, this would require a full rewrite of the messaging client but with the Chat SDK it can be achieved by changing one line of code! 

If you want more details about writing a custom network adapter you can email us at [team@sdk.chat](mailto:team@sdk.chat).
